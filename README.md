## Introduction

This repo contains code for a sample application that uses the capabilities of the Architected Back-end-as-Service API. The application is built using Expo and React Native and serves as a sample for building applications with Architected.

## Features

The application is a simple file manager that provides an email/password sign-up/sign-in experience and the ability for users to upload images to their account.

This application is also a companion to the next js sample app which can be found [here](https://github.com/Architected/next-js-sample-app)
