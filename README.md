## Introduction

This repo contains code for a sample application that uses the capabilities of the Architected Back-end-as-Service API. The application is built using Expo and React NAtive and serves as a sample for both learning and building applications with the API.

## Features

The application is a simple file manager that provides an email/password sign-up/sign-in experience and the ability to upload images to a user account. It also acts and behaves as a companion to the next js sample app which can be found [here](https://github.com/Architected/next-js-sample-app)
